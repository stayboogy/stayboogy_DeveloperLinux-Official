# DeveloperLinux
Debian 11.7 Based Developer Linux, or D'V'R Linux, or DLinux


- Debian 11.7 Bullseye Based, "D'Linux," or "Developer Linux," or "d'v'r Linux"

- This is my personal basic setup for Debian that I use for all sorts of development projects

- This is my base Desktop Environment that I prefer over anything that comes pre-packaged

- What is included here will build you a Live Installer of Developer Linux

- Long Live Linux

# Prebuilt ISO 

- this is a prebuilt iso of what you get from following the directions here - I don't guarantee your wifi will be working, but everything else should be

- to join the files:

```
cd DeveloperLinux-Official/Prebuilt-Installer-iso
cat x* > DeveloperLinuxLive-Installer.iso
```

- to login once live system is booted:

```
user: root
password: root
```
